## Introduction

I primarily develop using TypeScript, React, and Node.js. While I enjoy learning new technologies, I strive to learn and use technologies that are appropriate for solving defined problems.

I prefer working under well-designed problems and hypotheses. I hope to build value within a cycle of data-driven hypothesis validation, success, and failure.

Ultimately, I want to live a life that creates good value in the world and shares positive energy, even if it's not grandiose.

#### MMP (Marketing Management Platform) Internal Shared Library

- Developed and deployed an internal shared library to npm so that web services wouldn't need to write data fetching logic and components every time they wanted to use materials registered in the MMP project that manages ad campaigns, ad groups, and materials.
- Built a library that automatically generates UI forms for material render_types based on JSON-stored schemas.
- Learned about additional considerations needed when writing code for shared use rather than code for a single project.
- Beyond just working well, it needed to be user-friendly and meet desired use cases. I also learned that for users to use it well, good documentation and promotion are important beyond simply writing good code.

#### CashNote Market

- Participated in developing a marketplace service for business owners using CashNote.
- Gained experience learning and using AWS services like ECS, Fargate, ALB, and CloudFront directly while actively utilizing Next.js for infrastructure.
- Developed with consideration for providing the best user experience by appropriately using Next.js SSR, SSG, ISR, etc.
- Worked on automating REST API request and response typing using OpenAPI specifications.
- Developed the service while writing integration tests using technologies like Storybook, Jest, react-testing-library, and MSW.
- Configured and implemented Segment event processing to check overall service metrics. Also proposed and implemented direct management of segmentation, funnels, user lifecycle, etc., in the Amplitude dashboard.

#### CashNote Market Partner Center
- Participated in developing a partner center for merchants entering the marketplace for business owners using CashNote.

#### CashNote Credit Score Inquiry
- Added a new feature to check business owners' credit scores through KCB.
- Had the opportunity to learn about SVG and directly draw graphs showing scores.

#### CashNote 2.0
- To solve the problem of slowing development speed due to increased complexity as the domain services I was responsible for grew, and to apply overall design improvements, I stopped development of CashNote 1.0 and proceeded with renewal to CashNote 2.0.
- Used React experimental version and appropriately used Suspense (code splitting + data fetching) and Error Boundary to separate concerns and improve overall code quality.
- Experienced using mobile interfaces to respond when used in in-app webviews.
