<h5 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Intro</h5>

I primarily develop using TypeScript, React, and Node.js. While I enjoy learning new technologies, I <b>strive to learn and use technologies that are appropriate for solving defined problems</b>.

I <b>prefer working under designed problems and hypotheses</b>. I hope to grow value within the cycle of validating hypotheses based on data and experiencing both success and failure.
Even if not grandiose, I ultimately want to create good value for the world and <b>live a life sharing bright and positive energy</b>.

  <div className="space-y-3">
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Background</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - The GraphQL server was only counting cases with status 500 and sending alerts when exceeding a threshold.
        - Some communicating servers were responding with 400-level errors as 500-level errors.
        - <b>Alerts inevitably occurred as traffic increased</b>, and the team <b>didn't take error alerts seriously</b>.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Approach</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - <b>Collected cases where servers returned 400-level errors as 500-level errors and requested improvements</b> from the server team.
        - <b>Error logs should converge to zero</b>, and <b>reviewed alert settings to check if warnings spike significantly above recent trends</b>.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Result</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - <b>Increased reliability of BFF-related error alerts</b> sent to Slack.
        - Systematically established criteria for viewing and managing errors at each level.
        - Learned once again that <b>unreliable error alerts are worse than having no error alerts</b>.

      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - Advertisers were <b>using outlink ads to collect customer information</b>.
        - <b>Users had to manually re-enter information already known by Karrot app</b> when submitting customer information through outlinks.
        - This situation was <b>negatively affecting ad conversion rates</b>.

    </div>
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Approach</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - <b>Developed a new ad product called lead forms</b> that can collect customer information with prefilled data from Karrot's internal information.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Result</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - Advertisers can now use lead forms instead of outlinks for customer information collection.
        - <b>Lead form ads recorded better conversion rates compared to existing outlink ads</b>.
        - <b>Considered how to manage code to maintain cohesion of funnel-related code</b>, and wrote code using and referencing the use-funnel library.

      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - Advertisers were <b>entering budgets too small</b> to even get bidding opportunities and <b>couldn't spend their budgets</b>.
        - Even when providing <b>configuration and performance information</b>, <b>small business advertisers found it difficult to analyze</b>.
        - There were internal discussions about whether AI could provide creative and diverse answers.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Approach</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - <b>Developed features to analyze configuration values and performance metrics according to AI and internally defined rules</b>.
        - Worked on writing and improving prompts to provide the most helpful answers to users when using AI.
        - Rather than just passing prompts to AI, <b>utilized information from top advertisers in the same industry to provide performance analysis in the most effective direction on the platform</b>.
        - <b>Designed UX to make it as easy as possible to apply recommended actions</b> from performance analysis.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Result</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - Achieved improvements in <b>preventing small budget inputs that cause budget underspending by encouraging application of recommended actions</b> through performance analysis.
        - <b>Gained opportunities to learn prompt writing know-how</b> while participating in prompt creation.
        - Since server responses came asynchronously, worked on solving this with UX, and <b>strived to create optimal UX by properly handling loading and notifications</b>.

<div className="mb-8">
  <h5 className="text-lg font-bold mb-3">[Small Business Ads Center Web and WebView Integration Project]</h5>
  <div className="space-y-3">
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Background</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - The ads center for small businesses was previously <b>developed and managed separately for web and webview</b>.
        - With relatively more webview users, new features were developed primarily for webview, <b>leaving the web product behind and creating spec mismatches</b>.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Approach</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - To solve the spec gap problem, decided to <b>write web and webview client code as a single codebase</b>.
        - Worked with mobile-first design, and created responsive designs when special web designs were needed.
        - When logic differed between web and webview, managed two sets of code.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Result</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - Web and webview code became unified, and features were developed simultaneously for both platforms thereafter.
        - The codebase became <b>bloated and complex by implementing responsive design and different runtime logic in one code</b>, making management difficult.
        - <b>Often compromised web usability by designing mobile-first</b> despite clear differences in good user experience between web and webview.
        - Realized that even when managed in one codebase, <b>some code inevitably needs to be duplicated</b>, and <b>some parts need to be separated to provide optimized experiences for each platform</b>.
        - Regretted that the originally identified problem could have been solved differently through project management changes or common logic packages rather than simply merging into one codebase. <b>Learned again that designing appropriate solutions based on deep understanding of background and problems is most important</b>.

      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - There were many values to configure when creating ads in the small business ads center webview service, resulting in <b>deep funnels with poor conversion rates at certain stages</b>.
        - Since ad creation was the first step toward ad revenue, the team was considering how to improve this problem.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Approach</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - <b>Developed an innovative one-page ad creation feature</b> that dramatically reduced the previously deep funnel.
        - Composed the one-page with only essential features for ad creation and simplified the funnel by hiding detailed customization features in the back.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div className="text-base font-bold text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1">Result</div>
      <div className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        - While <b>intuitively expecting better creation rates</b> than the existing funnel, the result was actually <b>lower creation rates</b>.
        - Learned that reducing funnels doesn't always lead to better results. <b>Learned that delivering information users need to know and inducing actions is more important than funnel depth</b>.
